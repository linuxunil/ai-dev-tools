# Standard Test Codebase

This directory contains a standardized codebase for testing AI development tools with consistent patterns, complexity levels, and known issues.

## Structure

- `simple/` - Basic code patterns for fundamental testing
- `medium/` - Moderate complexity with common patterns
- `complex/` - High complexity with multiple patterns and issues
- `problematic/` - Code with known safety and quality issues

## Usage

All AI development tools should use this codebase for consistent testing and benchmarking. This ensures reproducible results across different model runs and tool iterations.
